some structural and aerelastic considerations of high

  the dominating factors in structural design of high-speed
aircraft are thermal and aeroelastic in origin .  the subject
matter is concerned largely with a discussion of these factors and
their interrelation with one another .  a summary is presented
of some of the analytical and experimental tools available to
aeronautical engineers to meet the demands of high-speed flight
upon aircraft structures .  the state of the art with respect to
heat transfer from the boundary layer into the structure, modes
of failure under combined load as well as thermal inputs and
acrothermoelasticity is discussed .  methods of attacking and
alleviating structural and aeroelastic problems of high-speed
flight are summarized .  finally, some avenues of fundamental
research are suggested .

piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the
aeroelastician .
  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

  theory and experiments of the flutter of a buckled plate are

from flatness or a static pressure differential across the plate
raises the critical value of the /reduced velocity ./
  the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized
problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by
several authors .  in this paper the flutter condition was
formulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically
by the method of iteration and the method of matrix
approximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes .  for a
plate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm those
given by the galerkin method .
  an approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude of
the flutter motion for a buckled plate is presented .

theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated
air .
  the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the
case of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a
dissociated state .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atom
recombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shown
that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly
to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the
chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is
not in thermochemical equilibrium .
  two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point
equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the
other for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are
correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical
formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions
made .
  for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to
atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are
considered .  a solution is represented which shows the transition
from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination
rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) .
a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the
nonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is
involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on
bodies of different sizes .
  it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium
stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately by
a simple correlation formula and that the heat
transfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of the
boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis
number near unity .

a new technique for investigating heat transfer and
surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions .
on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic
vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid
flow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theory
can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena,
the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock
detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution .
furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be
used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other
surface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtl
boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the
inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior .
  it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can
also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in
conjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, a
means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface
phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers .

angular accelerations, without requiring determination of the heat flux
at each point on the surface and its variation with time .
acting on the aerodynamically heated structural model to those acting
on the aircraft is determined for the case of zero angular velocity and
zero angular acceleration, so that the structural model may be subjected

analysis .
  the method is used to calculate the flutter speed of some wings

  the hypersonic similarity law as derived by tsien has been
investigated by comparing the pressure distributions along bodies of
revolution at zero angle of attack .  in making
these comparisons, particular
attention was given to determining the limits of mach number and fineness
ratio for which the similarity law applies .  for the purpose of this
investigation, pressure distributions
determined by the method of
characteristics for ogive cylinders for
values of mach numbers and fineness
ratios varying from 1.5 to 12 were compared .
pressures on various cones
and on cone cylinders were also compared in this study .
  the pressure distributions presented demonstrate that the hypersonic
similarity law is applicable over a
wider range of values of mach numbers
and fineness ratios than might be expected from the assumptions made in
the derivation .  this is significant since within the range of
applicability of the law a single pressure
distribution exists for all similarly
shaped bodies for which the ratio of
free-stream mach number to fineness
ratio is constant .  charts are presented
for rapid determination of
pressure distributions over ogive cylinders for any combination of mach
number and fineness ratio within defined limits .

the effects of flow rotation .  it is
found that the theoretical pressure
distributions over ogive cylinders can be related by the hypersonic
similarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes .
  the error introduced into pressure distributions and drag of ogive
cylinders by ignoring the rotation term in the characteristic equations
is investigated .  it is found that
the influence of the rotation term on
pressure distribution and drag depends only upon the similarity
parameter k (mach number divided by fineness ratio) .
although the error in
drag, due to neglect of the rotation term, is negligible at k=0.5, the
error is about 30 percent at k=2.0 .
  charts are presented for the rapid determination of pressure
distributions for rotational flow over
ogive cylinders for all values of
the similarity parameter between 0.5 and

variations were made in an aerodynamic

the results, which are presented in nondimensional form, indicate that
decreasing the joint conductivity parameter lowers both the interior

ratios in the skin, and may considerably increase the peak stiffener
stress ratios,. increasing the aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter
decreases the interior and average temperature ratios, increases the
peak skin stress ratios somewhat,
but greatly increases the peak
stiffener stress ratios,. and increasing the ratio of skin width to skin
thickness produces only moderate decreases in the peak skin stress
ratios while moderately increasing the peak stiffener stress ratios .

unaffected with moderate cooling .  with extreme cooling, an adverse effect

in particular, the beneficial effects of a favorable pressure gradient
obtained with moderate cooling disappear with extreme cooling, and a

a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressure
around conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonic
flow .
exact conical-flow solutions are available only for circular cones at
zero angle of attack .  for nonaxisymmetric cones or cones at angle of
attack, only approximate methods exist .  these methods are generally
quite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certain
mach-number ranges .  a great need was therefore felt for a simple
approximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body at
zero incidence as well as at angle of attack .
such a method has been developed recently at lockheed and is presented
here in abbreviated form .  the method is based on the /equivalent-cone/
theory .  this theory determines the pressure on a conical body
utilizing information for a symmetric cone at zero angle of attack with the
same normal component of the free stream with respect to the surface as
the local element of the body considered .  this method works relatively
well at high mach numbers .  however, it is quite inconsistent at lower
mach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably from
circular cones .  the equivalent-cone method does not give satisfactory
results, mainly due to the fact that it considers only the local surface
element on the body independent of the other body elements in the
newtonian-theory manner .

thermo-aeroelastic similarity .  it is concluded
that complete similarity obtains
only when aircraft and model are identical
in all respects, including size .
  by limiting consideration to
conduction effects, by assuming the major
load carrying parts of the structure
are in regions where the flow is either
entirely laminar, or entirely turbulent,
and by assuming a specific
relationship between reynolds number and nusselt
number, an approach to similarity can
be achieved for small scale models .
experimental and analytical work is
required to check on the validity of these assumptions .
  it appears that existing hot wind
tunnels will not be completely
adequate for thermo-aeroelastic work, and
accordingly a possible layout for
the type of tunnel required is described .

some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than in
aerodynamic research .
a study is made of the advantages that can be realized in
compressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air .
most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic,
chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio of
specific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is based
on the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a
suitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas
mixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is
nontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and
comprised of commercially available components .
calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs
comprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of
three monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a given
mach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture
wind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be
appreciably smaller and would require much less power than a
corresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantages
can be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research .
the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and
proportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel
temperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at
flight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel
temperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve the
relaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with
temperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall
within this category .  other applications arise in heat-transfer
research since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl
number in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .

with several theories which analyzed the
transient thermal stresses in idealized wing
structures of high-speed aircraft .  various
theories were investigated which represented
the same idealized wing models and

assumptions regarding the temperature
distributions in skin and webs .  the theories

and initial conditions on plastic models and
then by correlating the theories with the

a significant general conclusion was

simplifying assumptions concerning the thermal

higher than the experimental

  a simple picture, known from the work of i. lotz, of the flow over
the forward part of a body of revolution in oblique flow is derived

point of the (forward part of the) body at any angle of incidence
depends on three parameters whose values vary along the body .  the
variation of these parameters along the body can be determined from a
relatively small number of wind tunnel or water tunnel measurements .
the necessary water tunnel measurements have been made for four axially
symmetric head shapes .  additional measurements have been made to
illustrate the theoretical conclusions .  the data for each head shape
are adequate for a determination of the pressure coefficient at any
point on the head shapes at any angle of incidence (up to 6, say) .
in particular they can be used to determine the peak suction at any
angle of incidence and so the conditions for the onset of cavitation
on the head .

reynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body of
revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range .  the
effect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions
and a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is

  the models were tested through a mach number range from 0.60 to 1.09 .
the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x
diameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack .
  an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected
the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly .  these effects
were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the
normal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flow
reynolds number range .  this increase is in agreement with theoretical
approximations .
  a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the
incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good
agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the
body .
  the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on the
pressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to a
mach number of 1.05 .  at this mach number the effect was to cause a

laminar boundary layer oscillations and transition
on a flat plate .
  this is an account of an investigation in which oscillations
were discovered in the laminar boundary layer along a flat plate .
these oscillations were found during the course of an experiment
in which transition from laminar to turbulent flow was being
studied on the plate as the turbulence in the wind stream was
being reduced to unusually low values by means of damping
screens .  the first part of the paper deals with experimental
methods and apparatus, measurements of turbulence and
sound, and studies of transition .  a description is then given
of the manner in which oscillations were discovered and how
they were found to be related to transition, and then how
controlled oscillations were produced and studied in detail .  the
oscillations are shown to be the velocity variations
accompanying a wave motion in the boundary layer, this wave motion having
all the characteristics predicted by a stability theory based on
the exponential growth of small disturbances .  a review of this
theory is given .  the work is thus experimental confirmation
of a mathematical theory of stability which had been in the
process of development for a period of approximately 40 years,
mainly by german investigators .

oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic
hypersonic strip theory .
  the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for
conducting boundary-layer transition experiments .  the use of the
shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled
boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles .
  boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on
optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder
models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and
roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) .
transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on
the model surface .
  the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic
feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a
hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the
entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that
transition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition
reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer
edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the
sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition
occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder
model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds
number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .
  the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical
portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an
extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled
hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition
reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of
the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition
reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the
results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer
cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with
a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition
reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary-
layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred
at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000
based on local external properties and a distance along the body
surface from the stagnation point) .
  the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to
be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the
reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the
transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer
cooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds
number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the
hemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number with
an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant
for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .

laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociated
air .
  a method of predicting laminar heat-transfer rates to blunt,
highly cooled bodies with constant wall temperature in dissociated
air flow is developed .  attention is restricted to the case of
axisymmetric bodies at zero incidence, although two-dimensional
bodies could be treated the same way .  the method is based on
the use of the /local similarity/ concept and an extension of the
ideas used by fay and riddell .  a simple formula is given for
predicting the ratio of local heat-transfer rate to stagnation-point
rate .  it depends on wall conditions and pressure distribution,
but not on the thermodynamic or transport properties of the hot
external flow, except at the stagnation point .
  experimental heat-transfer rates obtained with correct
stagnation-point simulation and high wall cooling in shock tubes are
also presented and compared with the theoretical predictions .
on the whole, the agreement is good, although in regions of
rapidly varying pressure there is evidence that the local similarity
assumption breaks down, and the theory underestimates the
actual heat-transfer rate by up to 25 per cent .

assortment of wings tested covered a variety of positions of the elastic axis

ratio of fluid density to wing mass) was varied over a range of values
from 1.2 to nearly 14 .  special emphasis has been placed on the lower
values .
  the experimental investigation has been supplemented by an
analytical investigation based on the two-dimensional aerodynamic theory for
incompressible flow .  in a few instances corrections for the effects of
finite span have been made .  in general, the theoretical results
followed the trends indicated by experiment except at very low values of
the relative-density parameter .  for these low values

not found experimentally .  at higher values of the flutter-speed
coefficient is shown to decrease with decreasing values of and

chemical kinetics of high temperature air .
  when a hypersonic object enters earth's atmosphere, a shock
wave is formed in front of it, and the air passing through this
shock wave is heated to high temperatures .  the shock heated
molecules equilibrate their translational and rotational
degrees of freedom within a distance of a few mean free paths .
to achieve equilibrium, it is necessary to excite vibration,
dissociate molecules, produce new molecules and produce ions
and electrons .  the problem is complex, since all these
phenomena occur simultaneously and because the reaction rates depend
on the temperature, density and composition which are changing
during the relaxation toward equilibrium .
  the experimental techniques used to investigate these
reactions are briefly discussed along with the resulting rate
expressions obtained by the various investigators .  a compilation
of the rate expressions for these reactions representing the
author's evaluation of all the available data is presented .
several pertinent problems which are not yet completely

flux per unit area at the sonic point of a nose cone may exceed
the corresponding laminar heat flux per unit area at the

laminar stagnation-point heat flux per unit area has been
estimated (2) to vary from about 1.0 to 10 for a hemispherical
nose as the reynolds number (based on nose diameter)
increases from 10 to 10 .  since for an axisymmetric body
the surface area in the vicinity of the sonic point greatly
exceeds the area in the vicinity of the stagnation point, the
ratio of turbulent to laminar heat fluxes to the entire body
will be much greater than the above quoted ratios of heat
fluxes per unit area .

with the development of high-speed aircraft and missiles, vibration
of panels has become a problem of practical significance .  many
of the failures of the early german rockets after attaining supersonic
speed have been attributed to the development of such panel
oscillations .  it appears this
phenomenon is not of much concern in the subsonic
speed range., however, in the supersonic speed range panels may develop
oscillations which cause instability of the structure .  this effect has
been exhibited experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions
motion is limited and buckling may not be a serious design problem .
in these cases panel flutter is still of importance because of its
effect on the fatigue life and the allowable stresses for design of
the panel material .
the oscillations of panels may be due either to aerodynamic force
induced by the motion of the panel, or to aerodynamic noise, or
buffeting (irregular motion induced by turbulence in the flow) .
the interaction between aerodynamic forces and panel motions, usually
referred to as /panel flutter,/ has been investigated by several workers
in recent years .  since the problem is too complex to be dealt with
in its entirety, simplifying assumptions have been made in these
investigations .  the literature is marked by a certain degree of
controversy over the validity of these assumptions and the applicability of
the results obtained .  a brief review of the literature with reference

  experimental studies of panel flutter were conducted at a mach
number of 1.3 to verify the existence of this phenomenon and to study the
effects of some structural parameters on the flutter characteristics .
thin rectangular metal plates were used in these studies and were
mounted as a section of the tunnel wall .  most of the data were obtained by
using aluminum-alloy panels, although a few steel, magnesium, and brass
panels were also used .  different materials with various thicknesses
and lengths were used to determine the effect of these parameters on
panel flutter .  the experimental program consisted of three phases ..
panels clamped front and rear, and (3) buckled panels clamped on all
four edges .
  panel flutter was obtained under controlled laboratory conditions
and it was found that, at the flow conditions of these tests, increasing
tensile forces were effective in eliminating flutter, as were
shortening the panels or increasing the bending stiffness .  no apparent
systematic trends in the flutter modes or frequencies could be observed,
and it is significant that the panel flutter sometimes involved higher
modes and frequencies .  the presence of a pressure differential between
the two surfaces of a panel was observed to have a stabilizing effect .
initially buckled panels were more susceptible to flutter than panels
without buckling .  buckled panels with all four edges clamped were much
less prone to flutter than buckled panels clamped front and rear .

transition point at the intersection of the two boundaries .  in the region
where a panel must be flat when flutter occurs, an increase in panel
skin temperature (or midplane compressive stress) makes the panel more
susceptible to flutter .  in the region where a panel must be buckled
when flutter occurs, the flutter trend is reversed .  this reversal in
trend is attributed to the panel postbuckling behavior .

  an investigation of the effects of aerodynamic heating on the
flutter of multibay external-skin panels has been carried out at a mach
number of 3.0 in the langley 9- by 6-foot thermal structures tunnel .  both
aluminum-alloy and 17-7 ph stainless-steel panels with a length-width
ratio of 10 for each bay were tested at dynamic pressures between
addition, a few tests were made on the lower vertical stabilizer of the
x-15 airplane which has external-skin panels unsupported for a length
  all panels showed flutter boundaries characterized by an increase
in panel thickness required to prevent flutter with increasing thermally
induced stress prior to buckling .  after buckling the panels showed
flutter boundaries characterized by a decrease in thickness required to
prevent flutter with further increases in thermal stress .  the largest
thickness required to prevent flutter in the presence of aerodynamic
heating occurred at the transition between the flat-panel boundary and
the buckled-panel boundary .  this peak value (for aluminum-alloy panel)
was as much as 60 percent greater than the extrapolated value for an
unheated, unloaded panel .
  values of the modified-thickness-ratio flutter parameter for the
unstressed panels (obtained by extrapolation) were in fair agreement for
the aluminum, steel, and x-15 stabilizer panels .  peak values at
transition, however, showed large differences due to apparently minor
changes in panel-support construction and or changes in panel-skin
material .

on flutter testing in high speed wind tunnels .
  the requirements for simulating in a wind tunnel flutter conditions
appropriate to high-speed flight are discussed, and an assessment is
made of the desirable features of a wind tunnel suitable for flutter
testing at transonic and supersonic speeds .
  it is concluded that such a tunnel should have either the mach number
or the stagnation pressure variable during the tunnel run, and that it
is of considerable advantage, and for some purposes essential, for high
stagnation pressures to be available .  the stagnation pressure required
to allow flight conditions to be simulated with a flutter model is
considered to range from at least 2 atmospheres for transonic speeds to
about 15 atmospheres for m = 4 .  no attempt to simulate kinetic heating
is envisaged, although its effect on stiffness should be allowed for in
the design of the model .  to minimise uncertainties due to the
variation of the model stiffness with temperature it is desirable that
means for controlling the stagnation temperature should be incorporated
in the tunnel .

the influence of aerodynamic heating on the flexural

  this report considers the loss of flexural rigidity of a thin wing due
to the presence of middle-surface stresses resulting from aerodynamic
heating .  the spanwise properties of the wing are assumed constant but
the wing section is arbitrary .  the loss of flexural rigidity is
comparable with the corresponding loss of torsional rigidity .

panel flutter tests on full scale x-15 lower vertical
stabilizer at mach number of 3. 0.
  panel flutter tests were conducted
on two full-scale vertical
stabilizers of the x-15 airplane at a
mach number of 3.0 in the langley
at dynamic pressures from 1,500 psf
to 5,000 psf and stagnation temperatures
from 300 f to 660 f .  flutter
boundaries were obtained for four of
the five distinct types of panels
which make up the vertical sides of
the stabilizers .  the boundaries
consisted of a flat-panel boundary
and a thermally buckled-panel
boundary .  the flat-panel boundaries were
characterized by a reduction in
dynamic pressure with increasing skin
temperature,. whereas, after thermal
buckling the trend was reversed .  the
minimum dynamic pressure for
flutter occurred at the intersection of
the flat-panel and buckled-panel
boundaries and represented a large
reduction in the dynamic pressure
over the extrapolated, unstressed value .
as a result of panel flutter,
three of the five distinct types of
panels were modified to provide the
required flutter margin on the design
flight dynamic pressure of the
aircraft .

static aerodynamic characteristics of short blunt cones
with various nose and base cone angles at mach numbers
of 0. 6 to 5. 5 and angles of attack to 180 .
  wind-tunnel tests have been performed
at mach numbers from 0.6 to 5.5
to determine coefficients of normal force,
axial force, and pitching
moment for short blunt cones, as affected
by changes in nose and base
cone angles .  models with nose half-angles
of 10 and 20 were investigated .
the 10 nose half-angle models were tested
with a flat base and with base
cones of 50 and 70 half-angle .  the 20
nose half-angle model had a 50
half-angle base cone .  reynolds numbers
for the test ranged from about
maximum diameter .
  variations in the base cone angle
resulted in significant changes in
the aerodynamic characteristics, with
lesser effects resulting from changes
in nose cone angle .  in particular,
the model with the 50 half-angle
conical base had only one trim angle
flat base and 70 half-angle conical
base had two trim angles (a = 0 and
a = 180) .  estimated variations of
the aerodynamic characteristics with
angle of attack by means of a modified
newtonian theory were in good
agreement with the experimental results .
the theory, however, failed to
predict the trim point at a = 180 for
the flat-based model .

free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .
  equations based on newtonian impact theory have been derived and a
computational procedure developed with the aid of several design-type
charts which enable the determination of the aerodynamic forces and
moments acting on arbitrary bodies of revolution undergoing either
separate or combined angle-of-attack and pitching motions .  bodies with
axially increasing and decreasing cross-sectional area distributions are
considered,. nose shapes may be sharp, blunt, or flat faced .  the
analysis considers variations in angle of attack from -90 to 90 and
allows for both positive and negative pitching rates of arbitrary
magnitude .  the results are also directly applicable to bodies in
either separate or combined sideslip and yawing maneuvers .

unsteady aerodynamic forces on a slender body of revolution

  linearized slender-body theory
is applied to the computation of
aerodynamic forces on an oscillating,
or deforming, body in supersonic
flow .  the undeformed body is a body
of revolution and the deformed body
is represented by movement of a line
through the centers of the cross
sections which are assumed to remain
circular .  the time dependence is
based on sinusoidal motion .
  for a body of vanishing thickness
the slender-body theory yields
the apparent mass approximation as it
is obtained for incompressible
crossflow around a cylinder .
  both linearized slender-body theory
and the apparent mass
approximation are used to calculate the
pitching-moment coefficients on a rigid
slender body with a parabolic arc nose
cone, and these coefficients are
compared with some experimental results .

  the applicability of the schlieren-photomultiplier technique to
obtain quantitative density measurements in the laminar
boundary layer induced by a traveling shock wave in a shock tube is
investigated .  tests were conducted at a mach number of 1.58
so that the data could be compared with the exact theoretical
solution tabulated by mirels .  the data obtained are in good
agreement with the theory if the distance of the light beam above
the floor of the shock tube is adjusted to fit the theoretical curve,.
this would not be necessary if a larger shock tube were used .
values of the transition reynolds number were also determined
which are slightly less than those found by martin using an
interferometer .  it is shown that this technique is sensitive enough
to detect changes in density that are only 0.000 per cent of
atmospheric density .
